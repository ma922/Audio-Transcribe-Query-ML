He looked so fit and he is so quick minded and so on I thought, all of a sudden it occurred to me I bet the way you eat, you know, is different. I bet you don't just eat a bunch of garbage and that started this thought. So, the basic three questions will be and I am recording it for you as well if I transcribe these for the book, but then I write about it and what has really been neat about it is that what started out as three same questions to everybody, everybody had kind of a different angle on it and I realized that they were creating the chapters for this book and of course Marci Shimoff read me right [???], I am not doing something where I did all the work and you are just transcribing it, but if you actually write in the book, I will do it. So I made her that promise and it was a hard promise, but it was a good one to make because it made me think more, you know. Second Speaker: Got you.
